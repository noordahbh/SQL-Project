 # SQL Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using SQL on a sales dataset.  
The project includes data exploration, key metrics calculation, and business insights.

## Main Steps
1. Explore database structure (tables & columns).  
2. Analyze dimensions (countries, categories, products).  
3. Explore data ranges (dates, ages).  
4. Calculate key metrics (sales, orders, customers, products).  
5. Compare by categories (revenue by country, gender, product category).  
6. Ranking analysis (Top & Bottom products by revenue).

## Key Insights
- Total revenue & items sold.  
- Customer distribution by country & gender.  
- Top 5 products by revenue.  
- Categories with highest revenue and costs.  

## How to Run
- Run `SQL_EDA_Project.sql` in your SQL environment.  
- Requires: `fact_sales`, `dim_customers`, `dim_products` tables.
